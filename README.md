# Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Sentiment Classification using LoRA

## 1. Introduction
This project fine-tunes the RoBERTa model for sentiment classification using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset. The objective is to classify sentences into positive or negative sentiments while utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to optimize computational efficiency. This approach enhances model performance without requiring extensive computational resources.

## 2. Dataset Selection: Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)
### Justification for Dataset Choice
The SST-2 dataset from the GLUE benchmark was chosen because:
- It is widely used for sentiment analysis tasks.
- It is pre-labeled, making it suitable for supervised learning.
- It contains balanced positive and negative sentiment samples, reducing potential bias.
- It is commonly used in NLP research, making it an ideal benchmark for model evaluation.

## 3. Model Selection: RoBERTa with LoRA
### Why RoBERTa?
RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) was selected due to its:
- Improved contextual understanding compared to BERT.
- Use of dynamic token masking, which enhances generalization on smaller datasets.
- Pretraining on large textual corpora, making it highly effective for fine-tuning.

### Why LoRA?
To improve efficiency, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) was applied:
- LoRA freezes the majority of model parameters, updating only a small subset of trainable layers.
- It significantly reduces memory consumption while maintaining performance.
- This technique is ideal for resource-constrained environments or projects requiring quick model adaptation.

## 4. Implementation Details
### Libraries Used
- ðŸ¤— Transformers
- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
- PyTorch
- Datasets

### Pretrained Model
- `roberta-base`

### Optimizer & Training Strategy
| Parameter       | Value  |
|--------------- |------- |
| Learning Rate  | 1e-3   |
| Batch Size     | 16     |
| Epochs        | 3      |
| Weight Decay   | 0.01   |
| Evaluation Strategy | After Each Epoch |

## 5. Evaluation & Results
The accuracy metric was used to evaluate the model's performance on sentiment classification.

### Sample Predictions
| Sentence | Predicted Sentiment |
|----------|--------------------|
| "A feel-good picture in the best sense of the term." | Positive |
| "The movie's biggest offense is its complete lack of tension." | Negative |
| "Impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises." | Positive |
| "It's just incredibly dull." | Negative |

The fine-tuned RoBERTa model successfully classified unseen sentences with high accuracy after just one epoch.

## 6. Conclusion
The RoBERTa model with LoRA fine-tuning proved to be:
- **Efficient** by requiring fewer trainable parameters.
- **Accurate** on sentiment classification tasks.
- **Cost-effective** by reducing memory and computational overhead.

This approach can be applied to real-world sentiment analysis applications such as:
- Customer feedback monitoring
- Social media sentiment tracking
- Movie and product review analysis

## 7. Future Improvements
To further enhance the model's performance, the following improvements can be explored:
- Fine-tuning on larger and more diverse datasets.
- Using multiple LoRA layers instead of a single attention head.
- Deploying the model as a real-time sentiment analysis API.
- Experimenting with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like **Prompt Tuning** and **Adapters**.
